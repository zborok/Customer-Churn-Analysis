# Customer-Churn-Apple-Share-Price-Analysis
In this analysis, two separate datasets were analyzed - one pertained to customer churn data for a telecommunications firm, and the other to Apple's share price. An 
articifical neural network (ANN) was used to model the customer churn data while a long-short-term memory (LSTM) neural network was used to model the share price data.
